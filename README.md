MHT Risk Assessment Tool

### About
https://premeno-frontend.herokuapp.com/about

MAsCoT has been built to communicate the risks and benefits of taking menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), also known as
hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It's aimed at women who are experiencing menopausal symptoms and are considering
their options. It is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor, it is instead intended to facilitate shared
decision making between a doctor and their patient.

This is the repository from the backend of the Mascot app. The backend, and further information, can be found
[here](https://github.com/actuary/premeno-backend).
